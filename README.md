## Abstract

In an era of increasing climate variability and change, accurate weather forecasting is of paramount importance. This has prompted the development of advanced machine learning models to better predict meteorological phenomena. In the context of Turkey, a country with a diverse climate that spans from the Mediterranean to continental regions, precise temperature forecasting is a vital component of daily life, agriculture, and disaster preparedness. In response to this need, we present a groundbreaking study that leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to enhance temperature prediction across various regions of Turkey. Our RNN-based approach harnesses the power of deep learning to provide more accurate and location-specific temperature forecasts, improving our understanding of Turkey's climate dynamics and its implications for various sectors, including agriculture, energy, and public safety.

## Context

In recent years, climate change has brought about significant shifts in weather patterns, making precise and reliable temperature forecasting more critical than ever. Turkey, with its geographically diverse landscape, experiences a wide range of climate conditions, from the coastal areas along the Mediterranean to the inland regions with more continental climates. These variations have a profound impact on various aspects of life in Turkey, including agriculture, energy consumption, tourism, and disaster management. Accurate temperature forecasts are pivotal for making informed decisions in these sectors. However, traditional weather prediction models often struggle to capture the complex and region-specific nuances of Turkey's climate. In this context, the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), has emerged as a promising solution to address the intricacies of weather forecasting in Turkey. RNNs excel in handling sequential data and are well-suited to capture the temporal dependencies present in meteorological time series data. Our study delves into this innovative approach to improve temperature prediction across Turkey, with a focus on enhancing the precision and granularity of weather forecasts in a region where accurate temperature information is of paramount importance.
